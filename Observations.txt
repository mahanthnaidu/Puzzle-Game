   WORKING:
     # I have changed the format of the program as i have used Fl_Box instead of Fl_Buttons 
         for parent of MyButton .
     # Used Fl_JPEG_Image Class as well to store the images .
     # Reason behind this being , it was becoming almost too difficult to place an image 
         as a label to a Button, so i decided to flip the program accordingly .
     # Have used fstream and strings to get the names of associated image file names into the program .
     # And did rest things as same as N_puzzle and some commands associated with image labels to boxes .
     
   GAME :
     # It consists of puzzle which contains 16 squares out of which one is black and remaining 15 are parts of the picture .
     # Initially all the 16 parts were jumbled randomly(created using random function) .
     # Only the  boxes around black box can be moved....remaining wont move .
     # If we click on any neighbouring box to black box then the clicked box and black box exchange their respective positions .
     # We should keep on going like this until we get the correct shape of the picture .
